In this work, we will model the light-sensitive region of the backilluminated 
sensor as a epitaxial silicon layer with a thickness $D$, which is coated
with a thin oxide layer of thickness $\delta$ to provide a realistic transmission 
coefficient.
The illuminated side of the epitaxial layer is considered to have a \PCC\ region
of width $W$, where some of the generated photoelectrons recombine before being
measured by the sensor.
\PCC\ is usually described by quantity called \CCE, the fraction of 
photoelectrons which do \textit{not} recombine and are measured by the sensor.
In Section \ref{subsec:Noise} we will see how \PCC\
affects the variance of the signal measured by an imaging sensor.

\QE\ is the average number of photoelectrons measured per photon and is a common 
performance metric for measuring sensor sensitivity.
It is given in \citet{Janesick2001} as
\begin{equation} \label{quantum-efficiency}
    \text{QE}(\lambda) = \frac{N_{e}}{N_\gamma}
                       = A(\lambda) \times \text{IQY}(\lambda) \times \text{CCE}(\lambda),
\end{equation}
where $N_e$ is the number of electrons measured by the sensor for a 
given wavelength $\lambda$,
$N_\gamma$ is the total number of photons incident on the sensor,
$A(\lambda)$ is the fraction of incident energy absorbed by the epitaxial layer, 
and $\text{IQY}(\lambda)$ is the ideal \QY, the number of photoelectrons generated 
per absorbed photon.

The absorbance $A(\lambda)$ can be determined from the optical constants of Si 
and $\text{SiO}_2$, using, for example, the popular IMD code \citep{Windt1998}.
For this work, we used our Python library, 
\texttt{optika} \citep{optika}, 
which uses the transfer matrix method described in \citet{Yeh1988} 
with the optical constants from \citet{Palik1997}, \citet{Henke1993}, and 
\citet{Rodriguez-deMarcos2016} to compute the electric field for every interface
in the sensor.
In \citet{Stern1994}, the authors assume no reflections from the unilluminated
side of the sensor for simplicity.
In this work, we compute the total change in Poynting flux into and out of the 
light-sensitive region of the sensor to determine $A(\lambda)$.
This treatment introduces interference effects for infrared wavelengths, 
which can be seen on the right side of Figure \ref{fig:eqe}.

The ideal \QY\ is given by \citet{Janesick2001} as
\begin{equation}
    \text{IQY}(\lambda) = \begin{cases}
        0, & 0 < \epsilon < E_\text{g} \\
        1, & E_\text{g} < \epsilon < E_\text{eh} \\
        \epsilon / E_\text{eh}, & E_\text{eh} < \epsilon < \infty,
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon$ is the energy of an incident photon, 
$E_\text{g} = \bandgapEnergy$ is the bandgap energy of silicon,
and $E_\text{eh} = \electronHoleEnergy$ is the energy required to generate one
electron-hole pair at room temperature.
Surprisingly, despite initial results to the contrary \citep{Fraser1994},
this simple relation is a good approximation across the entire wavelength range
considered \citep{Geist1996,Scholze1998,Fang2019}.

In \citet{Stern1994}, the \CCE\ is expressed in terms of a differential \CCE,
$\eta(z)$, which is the fraction of photoelectrons collected for a photon 
absorbed at a depth $z$ into the epitaxial layer.
The total \CCE\ is then the average differential \CCE\ weighted by 
the probability of absorbing a photon at a depth $z$,
\begin{equation} \label{cce}
    \text{CCE}(\lambda) = \frac{\int_0^\infty \eta(z) \exp(-\alpha z) \, dz}
                               {\int_0^\infty \exp(-\alpha z) \, dz},
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is the absorption coefficient of silicon for the given wavelength.

In principle, $\eta(z)$ is a function of the exact implant profile which is
usually impractical to measure, but see \cite{Stern2004,Boerner2012} for a case 
where the authors did have a measurement of the exact implant profile provided 
by the manufacturer.
In \citet{Stern1994}, the authors instead adopt a piecewise-linear approximation 
of the differential \CCE,
\begin{equation} \label{differential-cce}
    \eta(z) = \begin{cases}
        \eta_0 + (1 - \eta_0) z / W, & 0 < z < W \\
        1, & W < z < \infty
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\eta_0$ is the differential \CCE\ at the back surface of the sensor.
Plugging Equation \ref{differential-cce} into Equation \ref{cce} yields an
arithmetic expression for the \CCE,
\begin{equation}
    \text{CCE}(\lambda) = \eta_0 + \left( \frac{1 - \eta_0}{\alpha W} \right)(1 - e^{-\alpha W}),
\end{equation}
which can be used in Equation \ref{quantum-efficiency} to determine the \QE.

In \citet{Stern1994}, the authors define an effective \QE\ as
\begin{equation} \label{eqe}
    \text{EQE}(\lambda) = A(\lambda) \times \text{CCE}(\lambda),
\end{equation}
which is the quantity that is typically measured when calibrating a image sensor
\citep{Stern1994,Stern2004,Boerner2012}.
In Figure \ref{fig:eqe}, we've plotted the measured, effective \QE\ of the
\AIA\ \CCDs, and a fit of Equation \ref{eqe} to the data, which varied $\eta_0$,
$\delta$, and $W$, while holding $D$ constant.
We will use these fit parameters in the remainder of this article as a representative
example.

\UV\ solar astronomy is often shot-noise limited \citep{Lemen2012, DePontieu2014}.
The shot noise is described by a Poisson distribution with variance, 
$\left< N_{\gamma,\text{m}} \right>$, 
the expectation value of the number of photons measured by the sensor.
A critical point of this study is that $\left< N_{\gamma,\text{m}} \right>$ 
includes every photon for which at least one photoelectron is measured.
        
$\left< N_{\gamma,\text{m}} \right>$ can be expressed as a product of
the fraction of incident energy absorbed by the light-sensitive layer,
the probability that an absorbed photon will result in at least one electron
being measured by the sensor, $P_\text{m}(\lambda)$,
and the total number of incident photons, $N_\gamma$:
\begin{equation}
    \left< N_{\gamma,\text{m}} \right> = N_\gamma A(\lambda) P_\text{m}(\lambda).
\end{equation}
Partial charge collection raises the prospect that a photon absorbed in the 
epitaxial layer might not be detected at all.
The fraction of photons for which all photoelectrons are recombined before being 
measured, $P_\text{r}(\lambda) = 1 - P_\text{m}(\lambda)$, is given by
\begin{equation}
    P_\text{r}(\lambda) = \left[ 1 - \text{CCE}(\lambda) \right]^{\text{IQY}(\lambda)}.
\end{equation}

An example calculation of $P_\text{m}(\lambda)$ for the \AIA\ sensors is plotted 
in Figure~\ref{fig:probability}.
For long wavelengths,
$P_\text{m}(\lambda) \approx \text{CCE}(\lambda)$
since the ideal \QY\ is unity, and for short wavelengths, 
$P_\text{m}(\lambda) \approx 1$ since the ideal \QY\ is large.
However, in \UV\ wavelengths, $P_\text{m}(\lambda)$ is more complicated
and smoothly connects these two extremes.
Where $P_m < 1$ (in the \UV\ and visible) the Fano factor,
as measured from the front face of the sensor,
will be much larger than unity since fewer photons are detected in this region.

The energy resolution of silicon detectors is ultimately limited due to Fano
noise \citep{Fano1947}, the unpredictable variation of \QY.
Fano noise is usually expressed in terms of a Fano factor, 
$\mathcal{F} = \sigma^2 / \mu$,
the ratio of the variance to the mean for some random process.
Expressing noise in this fashion is convenient because for a Poisson random
sampling, $\mathcal{F} = 1$ (which is signal-independent, unlike the \SNR).

The Fano noise for silicon is commonly accepted to have a Fano factor of about 
$\mathcal{F} \approx 0.1$ \citep{Janesick2001}.
In part due to variations of the Fano noise as a function of wavelength and
temperature \citep{Fraser1994}, 
there is some disagreement in the literature around a more precise value for
$\mathcal{F}$ 
\citep[\& references therein]{Fraser1994,Lowe1997,Mazziotta2008,Kotov2018,Rodrigues2021,Rodrigues2023}.
$\mathcal{F}$ is often measured in the soft X-ray region,
traditionally with $^{55}$Fe sources, which have a high \QY.
For \UV\ wavelengths, where the \QY\ is near unity, it becomes impossible
to construct a distribution narrow enough to be consistent with a Fano factor 
that small.
Because this distribution does not exist,
and because $\mathcal{F}$ is so small compared to the other noise sources
considered in this study, 
we have decided to ignore the wavelength variation of $\mathcal{F}$,
and adopt a Fano noise model with constant $\mathcal{F} = \fanoFactor$,
which represents the best available measurement of $\mathcal{F}$ using $^{55}$Fe
X-rays \citep{Rodrigues2021}, and uses a skipper CCD \citep{Janesick1990} to 
minimize the effect of readout noise.

At high energies, the \PDF\ of the Fano noise is well-described by a Gaussian
\citep{Rodrigues2023}.
At low energies, a Gaussian model is problematic since it becomes likely
that $\text{IQY}(\lambda)$ will be negative for some samples.
For this work, we will use a scaled Poisson distribution,
\begin{equation}
    P(\text{QY}=k) = \frac{[\text{IQY}(\lambda) / \mathcal{F}]^{\mathcal{F} k} e^{-\text{IQY}(\lambda) / \mathcal{F}}}
                          {(\mathcal{F} k )!},
\end{equation}
which has the nice property of reproducing a Gaussian with the correct width
at high energies while also being well-behaved around
$\text{IQY}(\lambda) \approx 1$.
In Figures \ref{fig:photonNoise} and \ref{fig:electronNoise} we can see the 
contribution of Fano noise to the total noise measured by our simulated sensor.
Note how the Fano noise component is very small compared to the photon shot noise.

Recombination of photoelectrons in the \PCC\ region is a significant source of noise in
the \UV\ since the photons are absorbed so close to the surface,
where the \CCE\ is relatively low (Figure \ref{fig:probability}).
The probability of measuring an electron generated in the \PCC\ region is
described by a binomial probability mass function,
\begin{equation}
    P(N_\text{e} = k) = \frac{\text{QY}!}{k! (\text{QY} - k)!} \text{CCE}^k (1 - \text{CCE})^{\text{QY} - k},

in the near/far \UV\ and remains non-negligible into the \EUV.

In most backilluminated imaging sensors used for \UV\ astronomy,
the depletion region (the region with significant electric field) does not 
penetrate all the way into the device.
As a result, there's a so-called field-free region near the back of the sensor
where photoelectrons must undergo a random walk to find their way to the
depletion region where they can then be conducted to the terminals and measured
\citep{Janesick2001}.
This random walk generally leads to a loss of spatial resolution measured by
the sensor since electrons can diffuse to adjacent pixels.
It also leads to an apparent reduction in the noise measured by the sensor since
the blurring due to this diffusion induces a correlation between neighboring 
pixels.

Using Monte Carlo modeling, \citet{Janesick2001} found the following analytic
expression for the standard deviation of the charge diffusion kernel:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:chargeDiffusion}
    \sigma_\text{cd}(z) = \begin{cases}
        z_f \sqrt{1 - z / z_f}, & 0 < z < z_f \\
        0, & z_f < z < D,
    \end{cases}
\end{equation} 
where $z$ is the distance from the back surface at which the photon is absorbed,
\begin{equation}
    z_f = D - z_d
\end{equation}
is the thickness of the field-free region of the sensor,
and $z_d$ is the thickness of the depletion region.
Using Equation \ref{eq:chargeDiffusion},
we can find the mean variance of the charge diffusion kernel by taking an
average across the entire thickness of the sensor weighted by the probability of
a photon being absorbed at that depth,
\begin{align}
\overline{\sigma}_\text{cd}^2 &= \frac{\int_0^D \sigma_\text{cd}^2(z) e^{-\alpha z} dz}
                                      {\int_0^D e^{-\alpha z} dz} \\
                              &= \frac{z_f \left( \alpha z_f + e^{-\alpha z_f} - 1 \right)}
                                      {\alpha \left( 1 - e^{-\alpha D} \right)}.
\end{align}
The thickness of the depletion region or the field-free region is difficult
to measure, and depends on the voltage applied to the sensor and the charge
collected at the terminals \citep{Stern2004}.

However, \citet{Stern2004} did measure the size of the charge diffusion kernel,
for two discrete wavelengths, of a \goesCcdThickness-thick 
(100 $\Omega$-cm resistivity) \CCD for the GOES Soft X-ray Imager.
We can use these measurements to estimate the size of the depletion region
and model the size of the charge diffusion kernel as a function of wavelength.
\cite{Stern2004} didn't directly measure the size of the charge diffusion kernel,
instead they measured a quantity they named the \MCC, the fraction of charge
captured by the central pixel.
Naively, the \MCC\ would be the integral of the charge diffusion kernel over the
extent of a pixel.
However, since a photon can strike anywhere within the central pixel,
we need to convolve with a rectangle function the width of a pixel before
integrating.
So, our definition for the \MCC\ is
\begin{equation}
    P_\text{MCC} = \left\{ \frac{1}{d} \int_{-d/2}^{d/2} \left[ K(x') * \Pi \left( \frac{x'}{d} \right) \right](x) \, dx \right\}^2,
\end{equation}
where $K(x)$ is the charge diffusion kernel,
$\Pi(x)$ is the rectangle function,
and $d$ is the width of a pixel.
If we assume that the charge diffusion kernel is a Gaussian with standard
deviation $\overline{\sigma}_\text{cd}$,
\begin{equation}
    K(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi} \overline{\sigma}_\text{cd}} \exp \left( -\frac{x^2}{2 \overline{\sigma}_\text{cd}^2} \right),
\end{equation}
then we can analytically solve for the \MCC,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:mcc}
    P_\text{MCC} = \left\{ \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \frac{\overline{\sigma}_\text{cd}}{d} \left[ \exp \left( -\frac{d^2}{2 \overline{\sigma}_\text{cd}^2} \right) - 1 \right] + \text{erf} \left( \frac{d}{\sqrt{2} \overline{\sigma}_\text{cd}} \right) \right\}^2,
\end{equation}
where $\text{erf}(x)$ is the error function.

In the top panel of Figure~\ref{fig:chargeDiffusion},
we can have plotted a fit of Equation~\ref{eq:mcc} to the measurements in 
\citet{Stern2004} which found $z_d=\depletionThickness$ best matched the data.
Given the simplicity of our model, 
the fit is surprisingly much better than the models shown in \cite{Stern2004}.
In the lower panel of Figure~\ref{fig:chargeDiffusion},
we've plotted the corresponding standard deviation of the charge diffusion
kernel as a function of wavelength which predicts that the charge diffusion is
reasonably constant over much of the soft X-ray and ultraviolet wavelengths
since the penetration depth is low in this regime.
